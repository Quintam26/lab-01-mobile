#### Single-line Summary
Today we modified the starter code to make it responsive from mobile and desktop applications.
Under 640px width, a hamburger menu appears and upo clicking it navigation links display in a column.
Above 640px width the menu icon disappears and the navigation lnks appear side to side on the header.
Finally both the html body and images resize to only 100% max-width of the given size of the screen size.

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. We added a meta tag that to set up the viewport and proper scale.
  2. By using a span tag we added the menu icon which was in the wrong position.
  3. We switched roles and then proceeded to 'float' the menu-icon to the right side of the page.
